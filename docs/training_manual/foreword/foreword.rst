Foreword
========
Welcome to our course!
We will be showing you how to use QGIS easily and efficiently.

Why QGIS?
---------
As information becomes increasingly spatially aware, there is no shortage of
tools able to fulfill some or all commonly used GIS functions. Why should
anyone be using QGIS over some other GIS software package?

Here are only some of the reasons:

- *It's free, as in lunch.* Installing and using the QGIS program costs you a
  grand total of zero money. No initial fee, no recurring fee, nothing.

- *It's free, as in liberty.* If you need extra functionality in QGIS, you
  can do more than just hope it will be included in the next release. You can
  sponsor the development of a feature, or add it yourself if you are
  familiar with programming. 

- *It's constantly developing.* Because anyone can add new features and improve
  on existing ones, QGIS never stagnates. The development of a new tool can
  happen as quickly as you need it to.

- *Extensive help and documentation is available.* If you're stuck with
  anything, you can turn to the extensive documentation, your fellow QGIS
  users, or even the developers.

- *Cross-platform.* QGIS can be installed on macOS, Windows and Linux.

Now that you know why you want to use QGIS, these exercises will make you
know how.
